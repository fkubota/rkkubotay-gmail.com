Over 10,000 bird species occur in the world, and they can be found in nearly every environment, from untouched rainforests to suburbs and even cities. Birds play an essential role in nature. They are high up in the food chain and integrate changes occurring at lower levels. As such, birds are excellent indicators of deteriorating habitat quality and environmental pollution. However, it is often easier to hear birds than see them. With proper sound detection and classification, researchers could automatically intuit factors about an area’s quality of life based on a changing bird population.\\n\\n\\u003cimg title=”Bewick\\u0027s Wren © Derek Hameister / Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology ML214764391” src=\\u0022https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/Birdsong/Bewick\\u0027s%20Wren%20%C2%A9%20Derek%20Hameister%20_%20Macaulay%20Library%20at%20the%20Cornell%20Lab%20of%20Ornithology%20ML214764391.png\\u0022 style=\\u0022float: right; width: 250px\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\nThere are already many projects underway to extensively monitor birds by continuously recording natural soundscapes over long periods. However, as many living and nonliving things make noise, the analysis of these datasets is often done manually by domain experts. These analyses are painstakingly slow, and results are often incomplete. Data science may be able to assist, so researchers have turned to large crowdsourced databases of focal recordings of birds to train AI models. Unfortunately, there is a domain mismatch between the training data (short recording of individual birds) and the soundscape recordings (long recordings with often multiple species calling at the same time) used in monitoring applications. This is one of the reasons why the performance of the currently used AI models has been subpar. \\n\\nTo unlock the full potential of these extensive and information-rich sound archives, researchers need good machine listeners to reliably extract as much information as possible to aid data-driven conservation.\\n\\nThe [Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s Center for Conservation Bioacoustics](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/ccb/) (CCB)’s mission is to collect and interpret sounds in nature. The CCB develops innovative conservation technologies to inspire and inform the conservation of wildlife and habitats globally. By partnering with the data science community, the CCB hopes to further its mission and improve the accuracy of soundscape analyses.\\n\\nIn this competition, you will identify a wide variety of bird vocalizations in soundscape recordings. Due to the complexity of the recordings, they contain weak labels. There might be anthropogenic sounds (e.g., airplane overflights) or other bird and non-bird (e.g., chipmunk) calls in the background, with a particular labeled bird species in the foreground. Bring your new ideas to build effective detectors and classifiers for analyzing complex soundscape recordings!\\n\\nIf successful, your work will help researchers better understand changes in habitat quality, levels of pollution, and the effectiveness of restoration efforts. Reliable machine listeners would also allow conservationists to deploy more recording units worldwide and would enable data-driven conservation at a scale not yet possible. The eventual conservation outcomes could greatly improve the quality of life for many living organisms—birds and human beings included.\\n\\n\",\"mimeType\":\"text/x-markdown\",\"name\":\"description\",\"isPublished\":false},\"rules\":{\"id\":89221,\"postId\":6355246,\"content\":\"### One account per participant\\n\\nYou cannot sign up to Kaggle from multiple accounts and therefore you cannot submit from multiple accounts.\\n\\n### No private sharing outside teams\\n\\nPrivately sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted.

This is the exact problem facing scientists trying to automate the remote monitoring of bird populations.\\n\\n###Files\\n**train_audio**\\nThe train data consists of short recordings of individual bird calls generously uploaded by users of [xenocanto.org](https://www.xeno-canto.org/).\\n\\n**test_audio**\\nThe hidden `test_audio` directory contains approximately 150 recordings in mp3 format, each roughly 10 minutes long. They will not all fit in a notebook\\u0027s memory at the same time. The recordings were taken at three separate remote locations in North America. Sites 1 and 2 were labeled in 5 second increments and need matching predictions, but due to the time consuming nature of the labeling process the site 3 files are only labeled at the file level. Accordingly, site 3 has relatively few rows in the test set and needs lower time resolution predictions.\\n\\nTwo example soundscapes from another data source are also provided to illustrate how the soundscapes are labeled and the hidden dataset folder structure. The two example audio files are `BLKFR-10-CPL_20190611_093000.pt540.mp3` and `ORANGE-7-CAP_20190606_093000.pt623.mp3`.

Site 3 time windows cover the entire audio file and have null entries for `seconds`.\\n\\n- `audio_id`: ID code for the audio file.\\n\\n**example_test_audio_metadata.csv**\\nComplete metadata for the example test audio. These labels have higher time precision than is used for the hidden test set.\\n\\n**example_test_audio_summary.csv**\\nMetadata for the example test audio, converted to the same format as used in the hidden test set.\\n\\n- `filename_seconds`: a row identifier.\\n\\n- `birds`: all ebird codes present in the time window.\\n\\n- `filename`\\n\\n- `seconds`: the second ending the time window.\\n\\n**train.csv**\\nA wide range of metadata is provided for the training data. The most directly relevant fields are:\\n\\n- `ebird_code`: a code for the bird species.

Over 10,000 bird species occur in the world, and they can be found in nearly every environment, from untouched rainforests to suburbs and even cities. Birds play an essential role in nature. They are high up in the food chain and integrate changes occurring at lower levels. As such, birds are excellent indicators of deteriorating habitat quality and environmental pollution. However, it is often easier to hear birds than see them. With proper sound detection and classification, researchers could automatically intuit factors about an area’s quality of life based on a changing bird population.\\n\\n\\u003cimg title=”Bewick\\u0027s Wren © Derek Hameister / Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology ML214764391” src=\\u0022https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/Birdsong/Bewick\\u0027s%20Wren%20%C2%A9%20Derek%20Hameister%20_%20Macaulay%20Library%20at%20the%20Cornell%20Lab%20of%20Ornithology%20ML214764391.png\\u0022 style=\\u0022float: right; width: 250px\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\nThere are already many projects underway to extensively monitor birds by continuously recording natural soundscapes over long periods. However, as many living and nonliving things make noise, the analysis of these datasets is often done manually by domain experts. These analyses are painstakingly slow, and results are often incomplete. Data science may be able to assist, so researchers have turned to large crowdsourced databases of focal recordings of birds to train AI models. Unfortunately, there is a domain mismatch between the training data (short recording of individual birds) and the soundscape recordings (long recordings with often multiple species calling at the same time) used in monitoring applications. This is one of the reasons why the performance of the currently used AI models has been subpar. \\n\\nTo unlock the full potential of these extensive and information-rich sound archives, researchers need good machine listeners to reliably extract as much information as possible to aid data-driven conservation.\\n\\nThe [Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s Center for Conservation Bioacoustics](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/ccb/) (CCB)’s mission is to collect and interpret sounds in nature. The CCB develops innovative conservation technologies to inspire and inform the conservation of wildlife and habitats globally. By partnering with the data science community, the CCB hopes to further its mission and improve the accuracy of soundscape analyses.\\n\\nIn this competition, you will identify a wide variety of bird vocalizations in soundscape recordings. Due to the complexity of the recordings, they contain weak labels. There might be anthropogenic sounds (e.g., airplane overflights) or other bird and non-bird (e.g., chipmunk) calls in the background, with a particular labeled bird species in the foreground. Bring your new ideas to build effective detectors and classifiers for analyzing complex soundscape recordings!\\n\\nIf successful, your work will help researchers better understand changes in habitat quality, levels of pollution, and the effectiveness of restoration efforts. Reliable machine listeners would also allow conservationists to deploy more recording units worldwide and would enable data-driven conservation at a scale not yet possible. The eventual conservation outcomes could greatly improve the quality of life for many living organisms—birds and human beings included.\\n\\n\",\"mimeType\":\"text/x-markdown\",\"name\":\"description\",\"isPublished\":true},{\"id\":89224,\"postId\":6872705,\"content\":\"Submissions will be evaluated based on their row-wise micro averaged [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score).\\n\\nFor each `row_id`/time window, you need to provide a space separated list of the set of unique `birds` that made a call beginning or ending in that time window.
